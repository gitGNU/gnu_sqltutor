This chapter introduces basic concepts of Sqltutor project.

@section Tutorial Dialog

Sqltutor dialog consists of three main pages: opening dialog, tutorial
and final evaluation page. Tutorial dialog is designed to be as simple
as possible and is based on the very basic HTML constructs so it
hopefully should run safely on any web browser. The dialog is going to
be described on a case of trivial session in which we answer one
simple SQL query.


@subsection Opening Dialog

From the drop down list tutorial must be selected from the opening
dialog page.  Other options are optional. 

@ifinfo
@example
Tutorial    [None____]

User        guest________________     Password    _____________________

Min points  _____________________     Max points  _____________________
Dataset     _____________________     Help        [ ]

@end ifnotinfo


@table @env

@item Tutorial
Mandatory selection of the SQL tutorial. 

@item Continue
Press the @emph{Continue} button to open new session and start the
selected tutorial.

@item Display datasets
For the selected tutorial displays the table of available datasets,
tables and columns. Datasets are ordered by number of columns.

@item User
@itemx Password
Unused in the current version.

@item Min points
@itemx Max points
Options to limit the tutorial questions according to their point rating.

@item Help
When checked, @emph{help} button is displayed during the dialog, where
@emph{help} displays the correct answer(s) for the given tutorial
question.

@end table

@subsection Tutorial Dialog

Tutorial dialog page displays selected tutorial question, its
corresponding tables an their columns and text area for entering SQL
code.

@ifinfo
@example
[ Finish test ]

+---------------------------------------------------------+
|    Table    |                  Columns                  |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------|
|   actor     |   id, name                                |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------|
|   movie     |   id, title, yr, score, votes, director   |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------|
|   casting   |   movieid, actorid, ord                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------+

@table @env

@item Execute SQL 
Executes SQL query written in the text area edit component, evaluates
the result (correct or wrong answer) and displays the resulting rows.
Only correct answers are registered, user can execute his/her query as
many times as needed for getting a correct solution.

@item Display data
Display rows for all tables from the given dataset. Number of rows or
a table is limited to 50 for larger tables.

@item Help
This button is available if @emph{help} was checked in the Opening
dialog page. When clicked, Sqltutor displays one or more correct SQL
queries for the given question.


@item Next question
Next tutorial question. If all questions has been answered, tutorial
is ended.

@item Finish test
Close the session and go to the final evaluation page and close the
test.

@end table

@subsection Evaluation page

Evaluation page contains only one dialog button

@table @env

@item New test
Close the evaluation page and return to the new seession opening
dialog.

@end table

@noindent Evaluation page presents the basic review of the
closed session: elapsed time, session number, number of
questions. correct answers, total points from correct answers and
session evaluation. The final evaluation is calculated as the number
of correct points multiplied by ratio of correct to all questions
reduce by penalty points for wrong and missing answers. Penalty points
are defined as a Fibonacci series 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... .

All questions from the session dataset tables and answers are shown at
the evaluation page.  For wrong answers correct solution is also
given. For each question internal id and the number of points is
displayed in green font for correct answers and red for wrong or
missing queries.

@ifinfo
@example
Test finished ...   00:00:50   (session 48)

Number of questions :  1
Correct answers     :  1
Total points        :  1
Evaluation          :  1

        |-------------+-------------------------------------------|
        |   actor     |   id, name                                |
        |-------------+-------------------------------------------|
        |   movie     |   id, title, yr, score, votes, director   |
        |-------------+-------------------------------------------|
        |   casting   |   movieid, actorid, ord                   |

@section Sessions, questions and answers

When tutorial is selected from the opening dialog page and started a
new @dfn{session} is opened. Sessions record all options selected in
the opening dialogue, the start time and the session status which can
be @emph{open} or @emph{closed}. Session is closed when the tutorial
dialogue is regularly finished.

All @dfn{questions} asked during the tutorial sessions are recorded
keeping the track of your SQL answered queries. Number of tries during
tutorial dialog is not relevant for the final evaluation, only the
latest solution is recorded. An answer is registered when @emph{Execute
SQL}, @emph{Next question} or @emph{Finish test} button is pressed.

Each @dfn{question} registered in the tutorial database has a point
evaluation. Trivial questions are rated by 1 point, nontrivial
questions can have point rating up to 15 points. For each question one
or more correct answer is stored in the database. When help is enabled
during opening dialog, correct answers are displayed when @emph{help}
button is pressed. 

Questions are asked about data from @dfn{datasets}, where dataset is
one or more SQL tables. Datasets can be shared by different tutorials.
Sqltutor selects questions in random manner, starting from easy ones
to nontrivial. @footnote{If you explicitly chose min/max value of
points and/or dataset during opening dialog, questions are selected
simply in random.}

@subsection Final evaluation

Final evaluation of sessions is calculated as 
@iftex
@math{p \times (c/t) - n},
@end iftex
@ifnottex
p*(c/t) - n,
@end ifnottex
where @math{p} is the sum of points for correct answers, @math{c} is
the number of correct answers, @math{t} is the number of all questions
asked and @math{n} is a number of penalty points for wrong answers (1,
2, 3, ...).
